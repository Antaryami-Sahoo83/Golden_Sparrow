Explanation:

➜ The user starts at the Homepage where they are greeted with featured jewelry items and categories without Signin.

➜ They can then choose to Browse Categories, leading them to the respective Category Page.
On the Category Page, they can view a list of jewelry items in the selected category and click on an item to view its Product Details.

➜ From the Product Details page, the user can interact with the website in two ways:
Add the item to their Wishlist to save it for later reference.
Add the item to their Shopping Cart for purchase.
If the user chooses to view their Wishlist, they can see the list of saved items.

➜ If the user clicks on the Shopping Cart, they can review the items they have added and proceed to the Checkout Process.

➜ During the Checkout Process, the user is required to log in or sign up (if not already authenticated) to proceed.

➜ After logging in, the user provides the necessary shipping details and selects a payment method for Checkout.
Once the user confirms the order, they receive an Order Confirmation.

➜ The user also has the option to access their User Profile to view their order history and manage their account information.

Please note that this diagram provides a general overview of the user flow, and the actual implementation may have additional interactions and branches based on the specific design and functionality of the CaratLane jewelry website clone.
